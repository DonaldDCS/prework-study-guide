# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This Prework Study Guide webpage was created as a part of the prework portion of the Front-End Development Bootcamp, and this was driven by a desire to ensure that the information studied is logged somewhere, in a concise and easily accessible way, to allow for easy revision to ensure retention and provide a quick reference source.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
